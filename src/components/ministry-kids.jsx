            <p>There&rsquo;s nothing more important than investing in the spiritual growth of our next generation. Our mission is to help children build a solid, lasting Biblical foundation &mdash; one that will carry them through every stage of life and into adulthood with confidence in their faith.</p>
            <p>To support this, we use the <strong>&lsquo;Hyfi&rsquo; curriculum by Lifeway</strong> &mdash; a Christ-centered tool that helps kids understand the Bible as a unified story. As they move through our ministry from early childhood onward, they&rsquo;ll journey through the entire Bible multiple times with engaging lessons, creative activities, and hands-on crafts designed to deepen their understanding and love for God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
            <p className="kids-foundation-coda">Together, we&rsquo;re raising up a generation that knows God, loves His Word, and boldly lives out His truth.</p>
