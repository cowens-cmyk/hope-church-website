            <h2>God is moving!</h2>
            <p>
              God is moving in and through Hope Church! For years, Hope has met
              in borrowed and rented space, and God has continued to move.
              Generations is our next step of faith: twenty acres of land and a
              building to call home that God can continue to move for
              generations to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is more than a building. It&rsquo;s a place to worship
              together, space for kids and students to grow up in the faith, a
              space for all ages to fellowship and grow in the grace and
              knowledge of Jesus Christ, and a front door that stays open to
              continue to invite people home.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are excited that God is opening doors for us to walk through in
              faith! Will you partner with us on this journey?
