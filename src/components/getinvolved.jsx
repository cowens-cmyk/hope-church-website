              <p>The early church didn&rsquo;t just gather on Sundays — they shared meals, prayed for each other, and walked through real life side by side. Groups are how we keep that pattern at Hope.</p>
              <p>Most groups meet weekly in someone&rsquo;s home for about 90 minutes — a meal or snack, time in Scripture, and time to pray for each other.</p>

            <p><strong>Partnership is a commitment to actively participate in that body of believers.</strong> We believe God has not called us to sit back and be served, but to take an active role in serving and ministering in order to build up and strengthen the body of Christ.</p>

                <p>Not at all. Plenty of people come to Discover Hope to learn more and decide later — or to ask questions they&rsquo;ve been holding for a while. No pressure either way.</p>

                <p>Welcome! It&rsquo;s actually a great way to learn who we are without waiting through a few Sundays to piece it together.</p>

                <p>We provide childcare during the class for infants through 6th grade. Let us know on the form so we can plan staffing.</p>

                <p>About 90 minutes. We start at 6:30pm and aim to have you out the door by 8:00pm.</p>
