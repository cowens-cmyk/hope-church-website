      updated="September 18, 2026"
    >
      <p>
        Hope Church (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) runs hopejc.org and the Hope Church
        app for iPhone and Android. This policy explains what we collect, why, and what you
        can do about it. We have tried to write it in plain English rather than legal
        boilerplate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The short version: we collect very little, we do not sell anything about you, there
        is no advertising anywhere in our app or on our website, and you can delete your
        account and everything in it yourself, at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>When you use the website</h2>
      <p>
        Our website records anonymous, aggregate visit statistics &mdash; which pages are
        opened, roughly where in the world visitors are, and what kind of device they used.
        It is counted in aggregate and is not tied to a name, an email address, or a profile.
        We use it to understand which pages are useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not use advertising cookies or tracking pixels, and we do not share website
        visitors with advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you fill out a form &mdash; a connect card, prayer request, event registration or
        the contact form &mdash; we collect what you type: usually your name, email address,
        phone number, and whatever you choose to tell us. Those forms are hosted by Planning
        Center, our church management system.
      </p>

      <h2>When you use the app</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>You do not need an account to use most of the app.</strong> Messages, events,
        the Bible, giving and everything else work without signing in.
      </p>
      <p><strong>If you create an account</strong> (with an email address, Sign in with Apple, or Google), we store:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your email address, and the name and profile photo you choose to add;</li>
        <li>sermon notes you write;</li>
        <li>your place in a message you are part-way through;</li>
        <li>verses you highlight and notes you write in the Bible reader.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That is stored so it follows you between your phone and any other device you sign in
        on. It belongs to you. Nobody else who uses the app can see it, and we do not read it
        to target anything at you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Notifications.</strong> If you turn on notifications, your device gives us a
        notification token so we can send announcements to your phone. The token identifies the
        app on that device. If you are signed in, we also note which account the device belongs
        to and the name on that account, so notifications meant for you reach you and our staff
        can see who has notifications turned on. You choose which kinds of notification you get
        in the app&rsquo;s notification settings. Deleting your account removes all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How the app is used.</strong> The app sends us basic usage information: a
        random identifier created when the app is installed, the app version, and which
        screens and messages get opened. This tells us things like how many people listened to
        a message &mdash; never who listened to what as a matter of record. The random
        identifier is not your device&rsquo;s advertising ID, and before we store it, it is
        scrambled with a secret key. We keep that scrambled identifier with each day the app is
        opened, which is how we count how many people use it; it is not connected to your name
        or your account. We do not have, and do not use, any advertising identifier.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Searches</strong> you type in the app are sent to our own server to find
        matching messages and Bible passages. They are not stored against you or your account.
      </p>

      <h2>Giving</h2>
      <p>
        Giving is handled by Planning Center, through their Church Center service. Card and
        bank details are entered on Planning Center&rsquo;s own secure pages &mdash; they never
        pass through our app, our website or our servers, and we never see or store them.
        Planning Center&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.planningcenter.com/privacy" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">privacy policy</a> covers that part.
      </p>

      <h2>Who else is involved</h2>
      <p>
        We use a small number of services to run all of this. They process information on our
        behalf and are not permitted to use it for their own purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Planning Center</strong> &mdash; giving, event registrations, groups, forms, and our church records.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> &mdash; app accounts, profile photos, the storage that syncs your notes and highlights, and notification delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple</strong> &mdash; notifications to iPhones.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> &mdash; hosts our sermon library, audio, and app data.</li>
        <li><strong>Vercel</strong> &mdash; hosts this website.</li>
        <li><strong>YouTube</strong> &mdash; some videos are played in the app and on the site through YouTube&rsquo;s player, which is subject to Google&rsquo;s privacy policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What we never do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not sell, rent or trade your information.</li>
        <li>We do not show advertising, and we do not share anything with advertisers.</li>
        <li>We do not track you across other companies&rsquo; apps or websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Deleting your account and your information</h2>
      <p>
        You can delete your account, and everything stored with it, from inside the app: tap the
        person icon at the top right of the Home screen, scroll down, and choose{' '}
        <strong>Delete account</strong>. It removes
        your notes, saved places, Bible highlights and profile, and it cannot be undone.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you no longer have the app installed, you can ask us to delete your account here:{' '}
        <a href="/delete-account">hopejc.org/delete-account</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We act on deletion requests within 30 days. Anonymous, aggregated counts that cannot be
        linked to you &mdash; for example &ldquo;180 people listened to this message&rdquo;
        &mdash; remain, because there is nothing in them to identify.
      </p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        The app is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children under 13,
        and we do not knowingly create accounts for them. Information about children who attend
        our programmes &mdash; Hope Kids check-in, student ministry registration &mdash; is
        provided by a parent or guardian, is held in Planning Center, and is used only for the
        safety and care of your child while they are with us. Access is limited to the
        volunteers and staff serving that ministry, and it is not part of the app&rsquo;s
        account system.
      </p>

      <h2>Email and texts</h2>
      <p>
        You can unsubscribe from any email at any time using the link at the bottom of the
        message, or by replying STOP to a text. We&rsquo;ll still reach out personally about
        things you&rsquo;ve specifically asked us about &mdash; a prayer request, a visit, a
        baptism.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        This site uses small data files (cookies) to remember your preferences, such as light
        or dark mode and the last page you viewed. You can disable cookies in your browser
        settings; the site will still work, but a few preferences may not be remembered
        between visits.
      </p>

      <h2>Sermon video and YouTube</h2>
      <p>
        We publish our sermons to our own YouTube channel using a media system we run
        ourselves. That system uses YouTube API Services to upload our videos and to
        confirm which channel it is connected to. Our use of those features is also
        covered by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        YouTube Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our system stores an authorization token for our own channel, the channel&rsquo;s name,
        and the video ID of each sermon we upload. It does not read viewer data, watch
        history, comments, or analytics, and it has no access to any channel other than ours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our staff can disconnect the channel at any time inside our media system, or revoke
        access directly at <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google&rsquo;s permissions page</a>. Revoking access
        deletes the stored token and stops any future uploads; sermons already on YouTube stay
        there until we remove them.
      </p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <p>
        You can ask us at any time to see, update, or delete the information we hold about
        you. Email <a href="mailto:info@hopejc.org">info@hopejc.org</a> and we&rsquo;ll take
        care of it.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        If we change how any of this works, we will update this page and change the date at
        the top.
      </p>

// has to stay reachable and stay put.

    >
      <p>
        If you made an account in the <strong>Hope Church</strong> app, you can delete it and
        everything stored with it. You do not need an account to use the app, so deleting one
        does not stop you watching messages, reading the Bible, or giving.
      </p>

      <h2>The fastest way: in the app</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the Hope Church app.</li>
        <li>Tap the person icon at the top right of the Home screen.</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Delete account</strong> and confirm.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Your account is removed straight away.</p>

      <h2>If you no longer have the app</h2>
      <p>
        Email <a href="mailto:info@hopejc.org?subject=Delete%20my%20account">info@hopejc.org</a>{' '}
        from the address you used to sign up, with the subject <strong>Delete my account</strong>,
        and we will remove it for you. We will confirm by email when it is done, within 30 days.
      </p>

      <h2>What gets deleted</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your account and sign-in details</li>
        <li>Your name and profile photo</li>
        <li>Sermon notes you have written</li>
        <li>Your saved place in any message</li>
        <li>Bible verses you have highlighted and notes on them</li>
        <li>The notification registration for your devices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This cannot be undone, and it removes the same information whether you delete it
        yourself or ask us to.
      </p>

      <h2>What remains</h2>
      <p>
        Anonymous totals &mdash; for example that a message was listened to 180 times &mdash;
        remain, because they contain nothing that identifies you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Giving records are separate. They are kept by Planning Center and, because
        contributions have to be recorded for tax and accounting reasons, they are not removed
        by deleting your app account. To ask about giving records, contact the church office.
