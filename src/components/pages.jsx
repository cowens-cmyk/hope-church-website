            <p className="lead">Hope Church was planted in 2022 by a group of believers who wanted to create a contemporary church experience — one not encumbered by traditional constraints, but still deeply founded in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>We began meeting at Daniel Boone High School in March of 2022. Soon after, we renovated part of a building in the heart of Gray at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=5034+Bobby+Hicks+Hwy+Johnson+City+TN" target="_blank" rel="noopener" className="origin-address-link">5034 Bobby Hicks Highway</a>, and that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll find us today.</p>
            <p>We believe this is a place where God can move in and through the Tri-Cities, and we pray He continues to guide us as we walk in faith along the path He has set before us.</p>
